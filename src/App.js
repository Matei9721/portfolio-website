        whoami: <span> My name is <span data-entity="developer"> Matei Penca </span>. I was born in Romania, and after
        completing the high school there, I started a new chapter in my life by doing my Bachelor and Master degrees
        in different cities around The Netherlands. Currently, I am still living in the Netherlands, enjoying the
        not so frequent sunny days. My hobbies include running, biking and bouldering with occasional video gaming
        sessions. </span>,
        cd: (directory) => `changed path to ${directory}`,
        education: <span>I have started my formal higher education in Groningen, The Netherlands in 2019 where I studied
        Computing Science which is just a different term for Computer Science :) . Because I was always attrached to the
        business aspect of software and because I had somewhat of a premonition of A.I. taking over I decided to do a
        Master's in Data Science at the University of Amsterdam.</span>,
        experience: <span>My first experience with building A.I. powered software started at <span data-entity="company">Syntho</span> where I learnt how
        to build, test and deploy software in an Agile way. Working in a start-up was a great way to accumulate a lot
        of experience in a fast way. After that I moved my knowledge to <span data-entity="company">Elsevier </span> where I am currently focusing on
        building generative A.I. powered but also traditional ML applications. I am focusing on developing both on
        the technical side but also on the business understanding and managing side.</span>,

        spotify: <span> <br/> Here are 3 of my favourite songs I listed on repeat. As you can tell I like to listen to many genres and many languages,
            I hope one of these songs will be on your liking :)  <br/> <br/> <AudioPlayer  playList={[

            &nbsp;where I've build A.I. application in different
